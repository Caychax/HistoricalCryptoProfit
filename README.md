# HistoricalCryptoProfit

A PyQt Crypto Currency Profit calculator. This app simply uses past data of closing prices from all crypto currencies as of 2020, 
and calculates the profit made given a timeine from selected dates on the calanders. This was my first GUI using QT and python.
This represents my first step in the my learning process of PyQT.

The graph is still a work n progress.
